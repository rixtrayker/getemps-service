- **Database Operations**: Migration, reset, shell access
- **Docker Integration**: Build, run, push images
- **CI/CD Support**: Pre-commit hooks, release checks
- **Documentation**: Auto-generation, serving

### 2. Docker Makefile (`docker/Makefile.docker`)
- **Multi-stage Builds**: Development, production, debug variants
- **Registry Operations**: Push, pull, tag, authentication
- **Container Management**: Run, stop, shell access, logs
- **Security Features**: Vulnerability scanning, image analysis
- **Optimization**: Multi-architecture builds, layer analysis
- **Development Tools**: Debug containers, health checks

### 3. Testing Makefile (`scripts/Makefile.test`)
- **Unit Testing**: Fast tests, layer-specific tests, mock generation
- **Integration Testing**: API tests, database tests, end-to-end
- **Coverage Analysis**: Reports, thresholds, HTML output, badges
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarks, load tests, stress tests
- **Security Testing**: Vulnerability scans, auth tests, chaos testing
- **Test Database**: Setup, migration, teardown, data generation

### 4. Master Makefile (`Makefile.all`)
- **Unified Interface**: Single entry point for all commands
- **Convenient Aliases**: Short commands for common operations
- **Enhanced Workflows**: Combined operations for complex tasks
- **Help System**: Comprehensive command documentation
